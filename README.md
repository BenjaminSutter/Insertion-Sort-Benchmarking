# Insertion-Sort-Benchmarking
Class project for Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms
<br>
This project involved benchmarking iterative and recursive iterations of the insertion sort algorithm. Results of both versions were then compared using standard deviation and the coeffecient of variation to determine data sensitivty,
